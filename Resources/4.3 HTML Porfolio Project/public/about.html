<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Indra — a Computer Science undergrad with a soft spot for clean code, late-night debugging sessions, and the occasional caffeine-fueled “Aha!” moment. When I’m not wrestling with semicolons or DOM trees, I’m probably exploring the latest in AI, web dev, or cooking up ideas that make my projects a little smarter and a lot more human.</p>

<p>I believe in building stuff that actually works and looks good while doing it. Whether it's front-end finesse with HTML/CSS or back-end logic with Node.js, I'm always down to dive deep and make tech work like magic. Also, if there’s a hackathon? Count me in — I thrive in chaotic innovation marathons.</p>

<p>Outside the compiler, you’ll find me geeking out over music theory, minimalist design, or dissecting why some apps just *feel* better than others. I’m driven, curious, and here to make the web a more intuitive, inclusive, and intelligent space — one project at a time.</p>
