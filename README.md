# ðŸš€ My Web Development Bootcamp Journey

Hey! I'm currently learning web development through **Angela Yuâ€™s Complete Web Development Bootcamp** on Udemy.

I just started the course, and itâ€™s already super beginner-friendly and hands-on. Dr. Angela makes learning fun and easy to follow. ðŸ™Œ

Iâ€™ll be updating this repo with the projects I make along the way â€” from basic websites to full-stack apps (eventually ðŸ¤ž).

Stay tuned! ðŸ˜„
